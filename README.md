## Renext package

This repository contains the complete source code of the **Renext**
package, released on CRAN since 2010. The package is still maintained
but no new development is planned.

The [Renext Computing
Details](https://github.com/IRSN/Renext/blob/main/inst/computing/RenextCompDet.pdf)
document is available here, but is not included in the package source
tarball `tar.gz`. Although this document is more than 10 years old, it
is re-compiled from time to time with slight fixes/changes.
