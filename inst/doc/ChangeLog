	         CHANGES IN Renext User's Guide VERSION 2.0-12


CHANGES

    o The bibliography style was changed. Some classical references
    where added.

    o Some index entries were added.

    o The moment estimators are mentioned for some distributions. 
    This enlightens the comparison of the CV with unity.	

    o The description of the 'Lomax' distribution was enhanced, and the 
    'Maxlo' distribution is now described. In the 'estimation' 
    subsections for some special distributions, the concentration
    of log-likelihood is now mentioned.

    o In appendix B, the order of the distributions was changed so that
    the (quite unusual) transformed exponential distributions appear
    after Lomax and Maxlo.


BUGS/ERRORS FIX	          

    o For the log-normal distribution, there were an error in the 
    written density since 'y' was under the square root sign.
